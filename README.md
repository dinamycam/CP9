car projects:
these are the porjects me and my friend @hadiyadollahi are collecting
so that we can do some of them, in our free time, and see what comes out of them
however , things listed here are just basic ideas that will become better documented over time...


 ## 1.**autoConnect**
while somehow inspired by flexihub,
the basic idea is to have a music player,**but** way cooler!<br>
you can connect usb drives wirelessly to it!
this way, the number of simultaneously connected devices can increase significantly, limited to the wifi chip design; <br>
it can become even better, if you can control the player wirelessly, as well.

awesome , is'nt it? :smile:


### tools needed:
* [ 2 * esp8266 chips ](https://nurdspace.nl/ESP8266)
*   - one for acting as an Access Point
    - one for being the station
* a USB flash drive

    #### details:

    the esp8266 chip is one of the most awesome chips I've ever discovered
    i've found some tutorials related to using it.some firmwares, like a upython port, and an elua firmware! the possibilities are limitless!
    ##### ***testing and results:***
    * currently none ;)
